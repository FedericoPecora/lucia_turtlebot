lucia_turtlebot
===============

This repo contains launch + config files to bring up multiple turtlebots
including navigation in the Lucia arena, both in simulation and (later) on the
real robots.

Installation
------------

Install prerequisites:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu trusty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update -qq
sudo apt-get install -qq -y python-rosdep ros-indigo-catkin git build-essential cmake
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

Create a Catkin work space, clone and build our ROS stack:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/uos/lucia_turtlebot.git
cd lucia_turtlebot

# Use rosdep to install all dependencies (including ROS itself)
rosdep install --from-paths ./ -i -y --rosdistro indigo
sudo apt-get install -qq -y ros-indigo-rviz

source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
catkin_init_workspace
cd ~/catkin_ws

catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

The generated `setup.bash` file has to be sourced in each terminal that uses
this catkin workspace. It's best to add it to the `.bashrc` so that it is
sourced automatically whenever a new terminal is opened:

```bash
echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> .bashrc
```

Now close all running terminals and open a new one.


Running everything in Gazebo
----------------------------

```bash
roslaunch lucia_launch lucia_gazebo.launch
```

Now, you can use the "2D Nav Goal" tool in RViz to send navigation goals to the
first turtlebot. You can command the other two turtlebots by opening
"Panels" -> "Tool Properties" and changing the "2D Nav Goal" topic.
